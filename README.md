# Binary-Classification-Heart-Disease
Performed feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation with medical patient data. The dataset is the Heart Disease Dataset available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset. Each observation is a patient and each feature is a recorded health statistic or evaluation. The 12 features are used to predict the binary target value of heart disease. 

Forward subset selection was used to reduce dimensionality and select features. K-fold cross validation was used to determine the value of the L1 regularization coefficient hyperparameter that yields the lowest generalization error.

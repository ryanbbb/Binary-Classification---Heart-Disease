# Binary-Classification-Heart-Disease
Perform data wrangling, model selection, and evaluation with a medical dataset. The dataset is the Heart Disease Dataset available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset. Each observation is a patient and each feature is a recorded health statistic or evaluation. The 12 features are used to predict the binary value of the presence of heart disease. Forward subset selection was used to determine the complexity of the linear regression. Cross validation was used to determine the value of the L1 regularization coefficient that yields the lowest generalization error. The optimal models of linear regression and logistic regression were evaluated and chosen using cross validation.
